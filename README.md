# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

The purpose of this project is to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow users to filter the table data for specific values. 

The project will use only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 

The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!


### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Used an [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file to support data formatting.

* Used the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Listed columns in table which included `datetime`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in your HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listened for events and searched through the `datetime` column to find rows that match user input.
